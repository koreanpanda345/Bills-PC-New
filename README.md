## What can it do?
Handles the drafting process, which is know as the Draft Timer feature, which when you start the draft, it will keep track of timer, and dm users when its their turn, and get their picks. Their even is a Draft queue system for players to use, so when they are asleep they can still have stuff drafted for them. It even handles Skips. 

Whats more is that the bot is always changing, and having new and useful tools being added, by people like you. Bill's PC is what I call a community bot. This means that its as strong as its community, and is not "my bot" its our bot, I am just the guy that programmed it, thats it. 

Whats even better is that it is completely free to use. No hidden charges, no hidden features, no premium tier, none of that kind of stuff. everything is completely free. So what are you waiting for?
